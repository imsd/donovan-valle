Data Visualization Project


The idea of my project is to visualize the alarmingly fast rate of world births. Visually, I’d like to create some type of cup or container in which unity spheres will drop from the sky into the container at the rate in which births happen. The sight of this massive container overflowing with spheres (humans) will then show the impact of how fast humans are born into this world. 

I’d also like to do something with the death rates as well, maybe some sort of opposite action. The idea I had in mind was the at the start of the simulation, a random large amount of spheres will fall into a container, but I’d want the spheres to explode or disappear at the same rate of deaths. I still have to think about how I would visually show that in an interesting way, but I’d like to do something with life and death. 

The code will be very simple for the birth, I’d have some gameobject instantiate at the rate in which the data shows of how many births occurred in the last year. Because there is no way to derive real time data for birthrates, I used the average from the census and then used the average per second. Website used for data: http://www.worldometers.info/
