Final Project - Data Visualization 

My idea for this project was to use the data of birthrates in the world. According to the CDC, nearly 4 people are born every second.

The goal for this project was to make this data visually stimulating, while also giving the user some ways to interact with the piece. For visual inspiration, I used Stanley Kubrick's film "2001: A Space Odyssey" as a reference. The monolith is in the center of the piece, spawning humans (spheres) at roughly 4 per second, while playing random notes from an array of 12 musical notes, everytime a human makes contact with the world (or the surface).

For controls, use the up, down, left, and right keys to control your movement with the space.

To rotate camera: use the "A" key for left, and the "S" key for right.
